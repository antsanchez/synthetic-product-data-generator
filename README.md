# Synthetic Product Data Generation Notebook
This project houses a Jupyter Notebook designed to leverage the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) via the [LangChain framework](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) for the generation of synthetic product data. It aims to provide a versatile tool for generating realistic product listings, which can be customized and used across various domains, particularly e-commerce.

## Author
This project is developed by Antonio SÃ¡nchez. For more details about his work and projects, visit [asanchez.dev](https://asanchez.dev).

## Motivation
The primary motivations behind this project include:

- **Exploration of LangChain**: Diving into the LangChain framework to understand its potential and how it can be leveraged with different LLMs.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Experimenting with diverse prompts to see their impact on the data generated by LLMs.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creating synthetic data for e-commerce and other projects, which can be particularly useful for testing, development, and analysis purposes.

This notebook serves as a practical exploration of these areas, showcasing how custom prompts and different LLMs can be utilized to generate data that is both varied and relevant to specific use cases.

## About the Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook included in this repository is a comprehensive tool that guides users through the process of generating synthetic product data. It allows for extensive customization, enabling users to specify details such as the type of shop, the number of categories, vendors, and products to generate, along with the maximum attempts for LLMs to generate each product detail.

### Key Features:

- Generation of vendor names and product categories.
- Creation of random combinations of categories and vendors based on user-specified parameters.
- Detailed generation of product information, including titles, descriptions, and prices.

For detailed instructions on how to run the notebook, customize the generation parameters, and understand the complete workflow, please refer directly to the notebook included in this repository.

## Installation
Before running the notebook, ensure you have Python installed on your system. The project relies on several third-party libraries, which can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas tqdm langchain langchain_core
```

Alternatively, if you have a requirements.txt file in your repository:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
